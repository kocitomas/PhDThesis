\chapter{Elements of Statistical Mechanics}
Statistical mechanics aims at explaining the microscopic origins of macroscopic properties of systems with a large number of degrees of freedom. The exact solution for a single phase space trajectory of a complex system requires enormous computational efforts and in most cases provides only a limited insight. In contrast to the chaotic motion of most phase space trajectories, collective system properties such as entropy, pressure, or temperature often exhibit relatively simple behavior. The formalism of statistical mechanics allows us to study these properties by considering the average behavior of a large number of identically prepared systems, i.e. the statistical ensemble. It is well established that in the thermodynamic limit all ensembles become equivalent. However this is emphatically not true in the case of intrinsically finite systems for which the choice of an ensemble is non-trivial. Therefore, I shall first discuss several prominent statistical ensembles starting with the most fundamental one, the \textit{microcanonical ensemble}.

\section{The microcanonical ensemble}
Let us consider a mechanically and adiabatically isolated system with a constant number of particles $(N)$, volume $(V)$, and energy $(E)$. At any given moment, the system is to be found in a particular microstate $\mu$, which is represented by a point in a $6N$ dimensional phase-space. At a fixed energy $E$, the accessible microstates are constrained to the surface of constant energy $\mathcal{H}(\mu) = E$, where $\mathcal{H}$ is the Hamiltonian of the system. The total number of microstates corresponding to a macrostate with a fixed energy $E$ is obtained by calculating the density of states\footnote{In the context of computer simulations, the energy space becomes by necessity discretized and the density of states is determined by counting the number of microstates within some finite energy range $[E,E+\Delta E]$.}\textsuperscript{,}\footnote{Alternative definitions of the density of states are more convenient in certain contexts. Please see section 2.3 for detailed discussion.}
\begin{equation}
g(E) = \int \mathcal{DP}\mathcal{DQ} \:\: \delta(E - \mathcal{H}(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{Q})),
\end{equation} 
where 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{DP}\mathcal{DX} = \prod_{n = 1}^{N} \frac{d^{3}p_{n}d^{3}x_{n}}{(2 \pi \hbar)^{3}}
\end{equation}
is the Lebesgue measure over phase space.
Assuming that no additional quantities are conserved, i.e. the system is ergodic, all accessible microstates have equal a priori probabilities. The microcanonical equilibrium probability distribution is given by 
\begin{equation}
p(\mu)_{E} = \left\{
\begin{array}{lr}
1/g(E), & \quad
\mathrm{if} \: \mathcal{H(\mu)} = E\\
0, & \quad \mathrm{if} \: \mathcal{H(\mu)} \neq E,
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
and the expectation value of an observable $O$ at a fixed energy $E$ is found by averaging over the surface of constant energy
\begin{equation}
\left< O \right>_{E} = \int \mathcal{DP}\mathcal{DQ} \:\: O(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{Q}) \:\: \delta(E - \mathcal{H}(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{Q})).
\end{equation}
The density of states of a typical mesoscopic system can easily span several thousands of orders of magnitude. It is therefore convenient to define the microcanonical equilibrium entropy
\begin{equation}
S(E) = k_\mathrm{B}\, \mathrm{ln}\, g(E),
\end{equation}
as an \textit{extensive} quantity with dimensions of energy over temperature.\footnote{Entropy would be a unitless quantity if temperature was measured in the more natural units of energy.}


\subsection{Microcanonical temperature}
Temperature is one of the fundamental concepts of statistical mechanics and has been traditionally defined in terms of the average kinetic energies of particles in a system. Here we motivate a more fundamental definition of temperature as an intrinsic system property, which can be obtained directly from the microcanonical density of states $g(E)$. For this purpose, let us consider an adiabatically isolated system composed of two weakly interacting subsystems, $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$. The energy of the combined system is fixed and can be written as the sum of the energies of the two subsystems $E = E_{1} + E_{2}$. The probability density for a given pair of subsystem energies $(E_{1},E_{2})$ is  
\begin{equation}
\rho(E_{1},E_{2}) = \frac{g_{1}(E_{1})g_{2}(E-E_{1})}{g(E)},
\end{equation}
where the density of states of the combined system is expressed as a convolution
\begin{equation}
g(E) = \int dE_{1}g_{1}(E_{1})g_{2}(E-E_{1}).
\end{equation}
In systems with many degrees of freedom, the probability density $\rho(E_{1},E_{2})$ is a sharply peaked distribution around the equilibrium energies $(\bar{E}_{1},\bar{E}_{2})$. These can be found by setting the energy derivative of the probability density to zero, from which we obtain
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{g_{1}}\frac{dg_{1}}{dE_{1}}\bigg|_{\bar{E}_{1}} = \frac{1}{g_{2}}\frac{dg_{2}}{dE_{2}}\bigg|_{E - \bar{E}_{1}},
\end{equation}
or alternatively in terms of the microcanonical entropy
\begin{equation}
\frac{dS_{1}}{dE_1}\bigg|_{E^{'}_{1}} = \frac{dS_{2}}{dE_{2}}\bigg|_{E - E^{'}_{1}}.
\end{equation}
Motivated by the familiar observation that interacting systems at thermal equilibrium have equal temperatures, we define the microcanonical temperature as 
\begin{equation}
T(E) = \left(\frac{dS(E)}{dE}\right)^{-1}.
\end{equation}
Frequently, it is more convenient to consider the inverse microcanonical temperature defined as 
\begin{equation}
\beta(E) = \frac{dS(E)}{dE}.
\end{equation}
In the following section, we discuss the central role of inverse microcanonical temperature and its energy derivatives in the classification of structural phase transitions.

\subsection{Microcanonical inflection-point analysis}
Unlike its canonical counterpart~-- the heat-bath temperature~-- the
microcanonical temperature is an
inherent property of the system. As such, it contains all the information
about the interplay of entropy and energy, and can be used to locate and
classify all structural transitions of the system. In fact a transition
occurs when $\beta(E)$ responds least sensitively to changes in $E$.
This is embodied by the inflection-point analysis
method~\cite{Bachmann2014,Schnabel2011}. In this scheme, the
convex-to-concave inflection points of $\beta(E)$ locate an energetic
transition point between ensembles of macrostates that can be crossed by a
change in energy. We call these ensembles ``phases'' (sometimes referred
to as pseudophases or structural phases), because this microcanonical
behavior remains also valid in the thermodynamic limit. If we introduce
$\gamma(E)=d\beta(E)/dE$, a transition is defined to
be of \textit{first order} if $\gamma(E)$ has a positive peak value
at the inflection point. In case the peak value is negative, the
transition is
classified as of \textit{second order}. This is schematically depicted in
Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig_3}. Based on the principle of minimal
sensitivity and Ehrenfest's original idea of characterizing the order of a
transition by the free-energy derivative at which a discontinuity occurs,
one can likewise introduce a hierarchy of higher-order transitions
microcanonically.
